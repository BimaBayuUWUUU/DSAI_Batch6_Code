    "health_text = \"Cardiovascular disease kills about 150,000 people in the UK each year. Bad cholesterol is one of the main reasons - it leads to blood vessels furring up and becoming easy to block. Blockages can be fatal - starving the heart or brain of oxygen and causing heart attacks and strokes. Cutting saturated fat and having a healthy diet, along with regular exercise, can help lower bad cholesterol. But this doesn't work for everyone. And, for some, genetic conditions - rather than lifestyle - increase their levels. Millions of people worldwide are prescribed drugs, most commonly statins, to reduce the amount of bad cholesterol in the blood. But reported side-effects and how often these drugs are prescribed has attracted controversy.\"\n",

    "sports_text = \"Mikel Arteta’s side wobbled in the 2-0 loss to Aston Villa in their last home league game, the pressure, tension and anticipation of going into that match having just seen Liverpool lose against Crystal Palace at Anfield earlier seemingly overcoming them. And the subsequent timid Champions League quarter-final exit to Bayern Munich raised the spectre that Arsenal were about to “choke” in the manner that agonisingly consumed them at the final fences of last season’s Premier League race. The response, a battling win at Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday followed by this champagne show in front of their own celebrating fans, should put to bed any suggestions that it could be a lack of character that will undermine Arsenal in the run-in. And to make the night even better for Arteta, it was one of his summer signings that has been the subject of so much scrutiny who underlined his growing status as something of a talisman – a player bought from this humbled, dysfunctional Chelsea.\"\n",

    "finance_text = \"The fresh all-time high was driven by a weaker pound and easing tensions in the Middle East. The index closed on Monday at 8,023.87 points to mark the new record, surpassing its previous high of 8,012.53 in February last year. It was up 1.62% at its close, with retailers M&S, Tesco, Sainsbury's and Ocado among the big risers of the day. Shares have benefitted from a weaker pound because the index on the London Stock Exchange has many firms with big footprints overseas. A weak pound makes goods they export cheaper for foreign buyers and helps inflate the value of business done elsewhere. The pound was down 0.2% at $1.234 as a result, representing sterling's lowest point against the US currency for around five months. Axel Rudolph, senior market analyst at IG, said the (de-escalation in the Middle East) also played its part to propel the FTSE 100 to its new record.\"\n",
